# CRM Analytics – Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) Prediction & Segmentation

This project focuses on **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) prediction and customer segmentation** using transactional CRM data.  
The end-to-end pipeline includes **data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering, probabilistic modeling, and business-oriented segmentation**.

The project is structured in a modular and scalable way, following **data science best practices**.

---

## Project Objectives

- Calculate **customer lifetime value (CLTV)** using probabilistic models
- Predict expected customer purchases in future periods
- Segment customers based on predicted CLTV
- Translate analytical outputs into **business-friendly insights**

---

## Methodology

The following models and techniques are used:

- **BG/NBD Model** – for purchase frequency prediction
- **Gamma-Gamma Model** – for monetary value estimation
- **CLTV Calculation** – 3-month and 6-month projections
- **Quantile-based Segmentation** – A/B/C/D customer segments
- **Outlier Handling & Feature Engineering**

## Data Privacy Notice

### Dataset

This project is built on a private customer transaction dataset provided by FLO, a retail company.

The dataset contains omnichannel customer purchase behavior (online & offline).

It is used for Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) modeling and customer segmentation.

The dataset structure is representative of real-world CRM data.

**Data Privacy Notice**

Due to confidentiality and data privacy policies, the dataset cannot be shared publicly and is therefore not included in this repository.

Data Access & Reproducibility

Although the raw data is not publicly available:

All data preprocessing steps,

Feature engineering logic,

Modeling methodology (BG/NBD & Gamma-Gamma),

Segmentation approach

are fully implemented and documented in the source code.

### Output Overview

Expected number of purchases (3 & 6 months)

CLTV values per customer

Customer segments:

A – High value customers

B – Medium-high value customers

C – Medium-low value customers

D – Low value customers

These segments can be directly used for marketing strategy, retention planning, and customer prioritization.
